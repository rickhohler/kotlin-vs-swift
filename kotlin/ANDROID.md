### Broadcast receivers

"Android apps can send or receive broadcast messages from the Android system and other Android apps, similar to the publish-subscribe design pattern."

### Content providers

"Content providers can help an application manage access to data stored by itself or stored by other apps and provide a way to share data with other apps. They encapsulate the data and provide mechanisms for defining data security. Content providers are the standard interface that connects data in one process with code running in another process."
